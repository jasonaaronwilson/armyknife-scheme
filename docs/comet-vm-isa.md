# Comet VM ISA

The comet VM runs a simple binary encoded insruction set. This
document describes the instruction format and then lists the supported
instruction.

The comet VM is itself an assembler (and linker and debugger) so it
could be used to assemble programs from assembly text format though it
is very easy to output binary encode programs.
