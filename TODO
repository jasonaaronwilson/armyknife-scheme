# TODO

* exit, <,  <=, =, >=, >, eq?, read, write, etc.
* test:expect and some tests!
* add hack to define so we can put a debug name on closures... (added
  but not working?)
* search for FIXME and TODOs and try to fix any that are easy
* why not use macros for casts for all types? as_string, etc.
* code in printer.c should print to a byte buffer.
*. change readlines so that we read enough when expression isn't
   finished.
* performance measurements
