# TODO

* add tail call annotations
* make tags an enum - hopefully allows gdb to display them
  better. probably the same for error codes.
* exit, <, >, eq?, read, write, etc. we should be able to run an
  infinite loop
* test:expect + some tests!
* add hack to define so we can put a debug name on closures...
* search for FIXME and TODOs and try to fix any that are easy
* why not use macros for casts for all types? as_string, etc.
* code in printer.c should print to a byte buffer.
*. change readlines so that we read enough when expression isn't
   finished.
* performance measurements
